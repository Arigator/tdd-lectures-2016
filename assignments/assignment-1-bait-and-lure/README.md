#Gaylord Lohiposki’s Bait and Lure Calculator (TM)

A customer has reported a bug in Gaylord Lohiposki’s BAL app. They say if you  do not choose the size of the motor on your boat, the calculator freezes.

A QA Specialist at Dr. Kobros Software has tracked the problem to a function within the BAL application. To solve the problem, we have extracted the function, and a corresponding test. Your immediate job is to:

1. Reproduce the bug by creating a failing test with the mentioned erroneus input
2. Fix the bug, and pass the test

Are there other likely places where the program fails?

A rumor has been circulating the office that the aforementioned function is badly written, and might require some refactoring. Your secondary tasks are to:

3. Refactor the function, and perhaps extract some parts into separate, logical functions
4. Test the refactored/extracted functions
5. Ensure the original tests also pass
