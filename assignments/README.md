# 2. Write a piece of software, tests first!

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaylord-lohiposki-8852a464](Gaylord Lohiposki), who is a dear fishing buddy of Markku Karhu, has asked Markku for a help.

Lohiposki's latest enterprise (which is also a bit fishy, to be honest) needs a new back-end logic for calculating product prices and such. The last software, which Gaylord bought from Silk Road 3.0, did not turn out to be so robust after all, even if the price was low!

Luckily Markku, who happens to teach a testing course in Metropolia, knows a bunch of able students who could do the job (and for free, of course). "They even know how to TDD, so the product will be top notch", said Markku to Gaylord.
